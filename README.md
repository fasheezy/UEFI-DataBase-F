# Open Source UEFI Libraries
This repository is listing of projects related to the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI).  According to [Garry Kranz](https://www.techtarget.com/whatis/definition/Unified-Extensible-Firmware-Interface-UEFI), UEFI is "a specification for a software program that connects a computer's firmware to its operating system (OS). UEFI is expected to eventually replace basic input/output system (BIOS) but is compatible with it."

This repository organized by loaders, apps, instructions, or others. The purpose of this repository is to catalog them by relevancy and function.
